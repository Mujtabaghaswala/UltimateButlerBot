Short description
- UltimateButlerBot runs on a sealed kernel as a local agent that writes, tests, and deploys tools for you.
- It self-upgrades and aims for minimal footprint, safe defaults, and strong ops hygiene.
- This repo is part of a bounty: sealed-kernel local agent that auto-codes & deploys tools. Self-upgrading. Scored for safety, ops, and footprint. 10k payout.

High-level flow
- Control Plane (FastAPI): receives tasks and user prompts.
- Agent Core: plans, writes code, runs unit tests, and deploys.
- RAG Layer: stores tool specs and docs in pgvector. Uses retrieval to ground agent plans.
- Local LLM Adapter: wraps local models or remote ones via adapter.
- Ops Runner: container orchestration via Docker Compose or k8s manifests.
- Audit Log: append-only audit trail stored in sealed storage.

Components explained
- FastAPI Control Plane
  - Exposes a REST API to submit tasks.
  - Provides health endpoints and metrics.
- Agent Core
  - Planner: breaks tasks into steps.
  - Code Generator: emits project files and CI configs.
  - Tester: runs unit and integration tests in ephemeral sandboxes.
  - Deployer: builds images and deploys via docker-compose or k8s manifests.
- RAG and Vector DB
  - pgvector stores semantic embeddings of docs and tools.
  - Retriever fetches relevant context for the LLM.
- LLM Adapter
  - Supports local-llm backends (Llama, MPT) and remote endpoints.
  - Includes a safety filter and context window manager.
- Sealed Kernel Container
  - Runs the agent with minimal host privileges.
  - Uses seccomp, user namespaces, and read-only mounts.
- Self-upgrade Controller
  - Verifies signature of new code.
  - Runs upgrades in a staging sandbox before switching.

Safety and scoring üõ°Ô∏è
- Safety policy
  - Principle: fail-safe defaults. The agent refuses destructive ops without explicit human approval.
  - Action gates: any write to production requires a signed approval token.
  - Capability bounding: network and filesystem access restrict by default.
- Scoring model
  - Safety score: evaluates action gating, sandboxing, and audit coverage.
  - Ops score: evaluates reproducible deploys, rollback strategy, and runtime health checks.
  - Footprint score: measures memory, disk, and CPU use on default tasks.
- Tests included
  - Safety tests simulate common risky prompts.
  - Ops tests verify deploy and rollback paths.
  - Footprint tests run a fixed workload and report peak usage.

Self-upgrade mechanism üîÅ
- Signed releases
  - Each release carries a GPG signature and a SHA256 manifest.
- Staged rollout
  - The agent downloads the release artifact to a staging dir.
  - It runs a complete test suite in a sandbox container.
  - If tests pass and signatures validate, the agent swaps symlinks to activate the new version.
- Rollback
  - The agent keeps the last two working versions.
  - Rollback runs in under 30 seconds in common cases.
- Audit trail
  - Every upgrade step writes to the append-only audit log with user, version, timestamp, and checksums.

Deployment options üöÄ
- Docker Compose (recommended for local testing)
  - docker-compose.yml includes FastAPI, pgvector, agent, and optional model server.
  - Compose brings up a small cluster for dev.
- Kubernetes (advanced)
  - Helm chart included for production.
  - Uses PodSecurityPolicy constraints and network policies.
- Single-host sealed kernel
  - Run the agent inside a sealed kernel container for the highest isolation.

Example workflows
- Auto-code a utility
  - POST /tasks with a task spec and test cases.
  - Agent sketches a plan, writes code, runs tests, builds an image, and posts the deployment URL.
  - Human approves production deploy if required by policy.
- Reproduce a bug
  - Provide logs and a runbook.
  - Agent retrieves relevant files from RAG and crafts a repro script.
- Create an ops script
  - Agent writes a Terraform, k8s manifest, or docker-compose snippet per the request.

CLI and API
- CLI
  - ubagent init ‚Äî create a local project
  - ubagent run ‚Äî run a task
  - ubagent status ‚Äî view agent state and scores
  - ubagent upgrade ‚Äî trigger a manual upgrade
- API
  - POST /api/v1/tasks ‚Äî submit a task
  - GET /api/v1/tasks/{id}/status ‚Äî check status
  - GET /api/v1/metrics ‚Äî Prometheus metrics
  - API uses token-based auth. Use HTTPS in production.

RAG, embeddings, and vector DB
- Embeddings
  - Use open-source embedder or remote service.
  - Store vectors in pgvector in a normalized form.
- Indexing
  - Agent auto-indexes new tool specs and docs during install and upgrades.
- Retrieval
  - Use a k-NN search to find context for the LLM.
  - Retrieve up to N chunks based on similarity and recency.

Local LLM support
- Plug-in adapter for popular local models.
- Manage context windows and chunking for long docs.
- Use quantized models when needed to reduce footprint.
- Offload heavy inference to remote model endpoints when allowed.

Monitoring and metrics üìä
- Prometheus metrics available at /metrics.
- Precomputed safety and ops scores update after each task.
- Grafana dashboard templates included in /deploy/grafana.

Testing and CI
- Unit tests for core modules.
- Integration tests spin up a compose stack and run a sample task.
- Security tests check for privilege escalations and broken sandboxes.
- CI pipeline uses GitHub Actions with required checks:
  - lint, unit, integration, safety-smoke tests.
